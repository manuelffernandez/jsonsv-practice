# Blogs with json-server

Simple blogApp made to practice with json-server.

## Try it out...
For this project I used v18.13.0 of NodeJS. There is a *.nvmrc* file to select the correct version with **nvm**.

<sub>See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for more info.</sub>

Open a console and type:

-  `npm i` to install packages.
-  `npm run start` to start the json-server.
-  `npm run dev` to run the app.
