# Blogs with json-server

Simple blogApp made to practice with json-server and react-router-dom.

#### What's the point...

The goal of this project is to generate a SPA integrating the concepts of async queries, global states provided by react context and the routing-navigation of 'react-router-dom'

I must make it clear that this project is **not** focused on the aesthetic. All the styles are inside the 'index.css' file.

## Try it out :rocket:
For this project I used v18.13.0 of NodeJS. There is a *.nvmrc* file to select the correct version with **nvm**. If you don't have it, ensure that you have installed that specific node version.

<sub>See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for more info.</sub>

Open a console and type:

-  `npm i` to install all dependencies.
-  `npm run start` to start the json-server.
-  `npm run dev` to run the app.
